The shebang line tells your computer that you want to run the script using Python 3.
The first line of all your Python programs should be a shebang line, which tells your computer that you want Python to execute this program. The shebang line begins with #!, but the rest depends on your operating system.

    On Windows, the shebang line is #! python3.

    On OS X, the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/env python3.

    On Linux, the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/python3.

You will be able to run Python scripts from IDLE without the shebang line, but the line is needed to run them from the command line.

On Windows, you can bring up the Run dialog by pressing Win+R.
A batch file can save you a lot typing by running multiple commands.
The batch files you'll make will look like this:
    @py C:\Users\Al\MyPytonScripts\hello.py %*
    @pause
You'll need to add the MyPythonScripts folder to the PATH environment variable first.
Command-line arguments can be read in the sys.argv list. (Import the sys module first.)
